Cancer! It's bad yo.

\item \textbf{Galactic Circos: User-friendly creation of Circos Plots within the Galaxy platform.} Circos is a very popular tool for visualisation of genome-scale data, especially in publications. While Circos is incredibly powerful and flexible, it is also complex to the point of requiring bioinformatics expertise to use. Helena Rasche and I created a Galaxy port of this tool, so that Circos plots can be configured by users via the browser. Due to the complexity of Circos, this became probably the single-most complex Galaxy tool wrapper as well. While not exposing the full power of Circos, it strikes a good balance between versatility and complexity, between flexibility and user-friendliness. Because of the complexity of this tool, we also created detailed training materials as part of the publication in order to increase the accessibility of the tool. TODO: don't plagarize saskia
